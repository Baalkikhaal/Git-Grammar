    "An interrupted workflow is a situation when we are working with an issue and there is an interrupt to fix an issue with high priority and we are not ready to push the working issue upstream as it is unfinished. Stash is a quick fix way to push unstaged changes to a temporary stash (in English stash means to hide in a secret location), so that the working tree is clean and matches the index. Now we can work with some new issue, then commit these changes and later pull back our stash to continue working with the earlier changes.\n",
