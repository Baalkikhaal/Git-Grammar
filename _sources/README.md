# Learn GITing using Jupyter notebook

Firstly, set up a python virtual environment

	python3 -m venv env-git
	source env-bit/bin/activate

the package needed is jupyter which is installed using

	pip install jupyter

or take the requirements from `env-requirements.txt` file

	pip install -r env-requirements.txt

or to replicate the environment exactly as used here (this is not needed as jupyter is quite stable), use `requirements.txt` file

	pip install -r `requirements.txt`

open the jupyter notebook

	jupyter notebook MiningGitRepository.ipynb and execute the cells linearly
