# Git Grammar

We attempt to learn the Git ecosystem in a way similar to how we learn a language. By first learning its grammar.

Git introduces a variety of **names** and **verbs**.

Various commands are available that are similar to the sentences.

Various workflows are commonly used that resemble a paragraph of logical content.

However it is not necessary to know only the content. It is equally important to know the context.

We cannot learn the grammar in a sequential manner of first learning the names, followed by verbs and so on...

This is because names are used in a specific context and that context involves knowing the appropriate verbs also.

So a **parallel** approach is recommended. Since we cannot present such an approach through the linear progression of a book,

we will rely on numerous linkings across the content. Also for readability, we color code the various parts of the grammar.

The names are color coded as Dodger Blue while the verbs are color coded as Dark Orange.
